[BURR]

There’s nothing rich folks love <span style="color:brown"><b>more</b></span>

Than going downtown and slumming it with the <span style="color:brown"><b>poor</b></span>

They pull up in their <span style="color:orange"><b>carriages and gawk</b></span> at the students in the common

Just to <span style="color:orange"><b>watch ‘em talk</b></span>

<br>

Take Philip Schuyler, the man is loaded

Uh oh, but little does he know that

His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, <span style="color:gold"><b>Eliza</b></span>

Sneak into the city just to watch all the <span style="color:gold"><b>guys at</b></span>

<br>

[COMPANY] Work, work

[ANGELICA] Angelica!

[COMPANY] Work, work

[ELIZA] Eliza!

[PEGGY] And Peggy!

[COMPANY] Work, work

The Schuyler sisters

<br>

[ANGELICA] Angelica!

[PEGGY] Peggy!

[ELIZA] Eliza!

[COMPANY] Work!

<br>

[PEGGY] Daddy said to be home by <span style="color:green"><b>sundown</b></span>

[ANGELICA] Daddy doesn’t <span style="color:darkblue"><b>need to know</b></span>

[PEGGY] Daddy said not to go <span style="color:green"><b>sundown</b></span>

[ELIZA] Like I said, you’re <span style="color:darkblue"><b>free to go</b></span>

<br>

But—look around, look around

The revolution’s happening in New York

[ELIZA & PEGGY] New York

[COMPANY] Angelica

[SISTERS & COMPANY] Work!

<br>

[PEGGY] It’s bad enough Daddy wants to go to <span style="color:brown"><b>war</b></span>

[ELIZA] People shouting <span style="color:blue"><b>in the square</b></span>

[PEGGY] It’s bad enough there’ll be violence on our <span style="color:brown"><b>shore</b></span>

[ANGELICA] New ideas <span style="color:blue"><b>in the air</b></span>

<br>

[ANGELICA & MALE ENSEMBLE] Look around, look around—

<br>

[ELIZA] Angelica, remind me what we’re looking for

<br>

[ALL MEN] She’s looking for me!

<br>

[ANGELICA]

Eliza, I’m looking for a mind at work

I’m looking for a mind at work

Woa-oah

[SISTERS] Woa-oah

[SISTERS & COMPANY] Work!

<br>

[BURR]

Ooh, there’s nothing like summer <span style="color:purple"><b>in the city</b></span>

Someone in a rush next to someone <span style="color:purple"><b>lookin’ pretty</b></span>

Excuse me, miss, I know it’s <span style="color:orange"><b>not funny</b></span>

But your perfume smells like your daddy’s <span style="color:orange"><b>got money</b></span>

Why you slummin’ in the city in your fancy <span style="color:lightgreen"><b>heels</b></span>?

You searchin’ for an urchin who can give you <span style="color:lightgreen"><b>ideals</b></span>?

<br>

[ANGELICA] Burr, you <span style="color:red"><b>disgust me</b></span>

<br>

[BURR]

Ahh, so you’ve <span style="color:red"><b>discussed me</b></span>

I’m a trust fund, baby, you can <span style="color:red"><b>trust me</b></span>

<br>

<u><b>【这里已经不只是押韵而是同音了，评委请加五十分谢谢】</b></u>

<br>

[ANGELICA]

I’ve been reading Common <span style="color:gold"><b>Sense</b></span> by Thomas <span style="color:skyblue"><b>Paine</b></span>

So men say that I’m <span style="color:gold"><b>intense</b></span> or I’m <span style="color:skyblue"><b>insane</b></span>

You want a <span style="color:darkblue"><b>revolution</b></span>? I want a <span style="color:darkblue"><b>revelation</b></span>

So listen to my <span style="color:darkblue"><b>declaration</b></span>:

<br>

[ALL SISTERS]

“We hold these truths to be <span style="color:aqua"><b>self-evident</b></span>

That all men are created <span style="color:pink"><b>equal</b></span>“

<br>

[ANGELICA]

And when I meet Thomas <span style="color:aqua"><b>Jefferson</b></span>

I’mma compel him to include women in the <span style="color:pink"><b>sequel</b></span>

<br>

[WOMEN] Work!

<br>

[ALL SISTERS]

Look around, look around at how

Lucky we are to be alive right now

History is happening in Manhattan and we

Just happen to be in the greatest city in the world

<br>

[SISTERS & COMPANY] In the greatest city in the world!
