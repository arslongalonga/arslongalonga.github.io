[AARON BURR]

How does a bastard, <span style="color:green"><b>orphan</b></span>, <span style="color:orange"><b>son</b></span> of a <span style="color:darkblue"><b>whore</b></span>

and a <span style="color:green"><b>Scotsman</b></span>, <span style="color:orange"><b>dropped</b></span> in the middle of a <span style="color:darkblue"><b>for</b></span>gotten

Spot in the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in <span style="color:purple"><b>squalor</b></span>

Grow up to be a hero and a <span style="color:purple"><b>scholar</b></span>?

<br>

[JOHN LAURENS]

The ten-<span style="color:purple"><b>dollar</b></span> Founding Father without a <span style="color:purple"><b>father</b></span>

Got a lot <span style="color:purple"><b>farther</b></span> by workin’ a lot <span style="color:purple"><b>harder</b></span>

By bein’ a lot <span style="color:purple"><b>smarter</b></span>

By bein’ a <span style="color:purple"><b><u>s</u>elf-<u>s</u>tarter</b></span>

By fourteen, they placed him in <u>ch</u>arge of a <u>tr</u>ading <span style="color:purple"><b><u>ch</u>arter</b></span>

<br>

[THOMAS JEFFERSON]

And <span style="color:peachpuff"><b>every day</b></span> while <span style="color:peachpuff"><b>slaves</b></span> were being slaughtered and <span style="color:limegreen"><b>carted</b></span>

<span style="color:peachpuff"><b>Away</b></span> across the <span style="color:peachpuff"><b>waves</b></span>, he struggled and kept his <span style="color:limegreen"><b>guard up</b></span>

Inside, he was longing for something to be a <span style="color:limegreen"><b>part of</b></span>

The brother was ready to beg, steal, <u>b</u>orrow, or <span style="color:limegreen"><b><u>b</u>arter</b></span>

<br>

[JAMES MADISON]

Then a hurricane <span style="color:peachpuff"><b>came</b></span>, and devastation <span style="color:peachpuff"><b>reigned</b></span>

Our man saw his future drip, <u>dr</u>ippin’ down the <span style="color:peachpuff"><b><u>dr</u>ain</b></span>

Put a <span style="color:brown"><b>pencil</b></span> to his <span style="color:brown"><b>temple</b></span>, connected it to his <span style="color:peachpuff"><b>brain</b></span>

And he wrote his first <span style="color:peachpuff"><b>refrain</b></span>, a testament to his <span style="color:peachpuff"><b>pain</b></span>

<br>

[BURR]

Well the word got around, they said, “This kid is <span style="color:cadetblue"><b>insane, man</b></span>!”

Took up a collection just to send him to the <span style="color:cadetblue"><b>mainland</b></span>

“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you <span style="color:cadetblue"><b>came, and</b></span>

The world’s gonna know your name! What’s your <span style="color:cadetblue"><b>name, man</b></span>?”

<br>

[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]

Alexander Hamilton

My name is Alexander Hamilton

And there’s a million things I haven’t done

But just you wait, just you wait

<br>

[ELIZA HAMILTON]

When he was ten, his father split, full of it, <span style="color:darkred"><b>debt-ridden</b></span>

Two years later, see Alex and his mother, <span style="color:darkred"><b>bed-ridden</b></span>

Half-dead, sittin’ in their own <span style="color:darkslateblue"><b>sick</b></span>

The scent <span style="color:darkslateblue"><b>thick</b></span>

<br>

[COMPANY]

And Alex got better but his mother went <span style="color:darkslateblue"><b>quick</b></span>

<br>

[GEORGE WASHINGTON and (COMPANY)]

Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed <span style="color:fuchsia"><b>suicide</b></span>

Left him with nothin’ but <span style="color:fuchsia"><b>ruined pride</b></span>, somethin’ <span style="color:fuchsia"><b>new inside</b></span>

A voice saying “(Alex) you gotta fend for <span style="color:deepskyblue"><b>yourself</b></span>”

He started retreatin’ and readin’ every treatise on the <span style="color:deepskyblue"><b>shelf</b></span>

<br>

[BURR and (COMPANY)]

There would’ve been nothin’ left to <span style="color:limegreen"><b>do</b></span>

For someone less <span style="color:limegreen"><b>astute</b></span>

He would’ve been dead or <span style="color:limegreen"><b>destitute</b></span>

Without a cent of <span style="color:limegreen"><b>restitution</b></span>

Started workin’, clerkin’ for his late mother’s <span style="color:mediumslateblue"><b>landlord</b></span>

Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and other things he can’t <span style="color:mediumslateblue"><b>afford</b></span>

(Scammin’) for every book he can get his <span style="color:orchid"><b>hands on</b></span>

(Plannin’) for the future, see him now as he <span style="color:orchid"><b>stands on</b></span>

The bow of a ship headed for a <span style="color:palevioletred"><b>new land</b></span>

In New York you can be a <span style="color:palevioletred"><b>new man</b></span>

<br>

[COMPANY and (HAMILTON)]

In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)

In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)

In New York you can be a new man

[WOMEN]

In New York

[MEN]

New York

[HAMILTON]

Just you wait

<br>

[COMPANY and (COMPANY)]

Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)

We are waiting in the <span style="color:brown"><b>wings for you</b></span> (waiting in the wings for you)

You could never back down

You never learned to take your time

Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)

When America <span style="color:brown"><b>sings for you</b></span>

Will they know what you <span style="color:SeaGreen"><b>overcame</b></span>?

Will they know you rewrote the <span style="color:SeaGreen"><b>game</b></span>?

The world will never be the <span style="color:SeaGreen"><b>same</b></span>, oh

<br>

[BURR]

The ship is in the harbor now, see if you can <span style="color:orange"><b>spot him</b></span>

Another immigrant comin’ up from the <span style="color:orange"><b>bottom</b></span>

His enemies destroyed his rep, America <span style="color:orange"><b>forgot him</b></span>

<br>

[MULLIGAN/MADISON AND LAFAYETTE/JEFFERSON]

We fought with him

<br>

[LAURENS/PHILLIP]

Me? I died for him

<br>

[WASHINGTON]

Me? I trusted him

<br>

[ANGELICA SCHUYLER, ELIZA, MARIA REYNOLDS]

Me? I loved him

<br>

[BURR]

And me? I’m the damn fool that shot him

<br>

[COMPANY]

There’s a million things I haven’t done

But just you wait

<br>

[BURR]

What’s your name, man?

<br>

[HAMILTON & COMPANY]

Alexander Hamilton!
